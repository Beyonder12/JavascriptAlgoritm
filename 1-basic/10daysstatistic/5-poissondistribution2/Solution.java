The number of repairs, , that machine  needs is a Poisson random variable with mean . The daily cost of operating  is .
Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure that they operate like new at the start of each day. Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
